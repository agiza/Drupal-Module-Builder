Drupal Module Builder is a command line tool for building 
drupal modules. It currently supports Drupal 6 but has room 
to support Drupal versions above and below. The script is
written with PHP and requires php-cli utilities and libreadline

There is a debian folder included to build debian packages 
form source - no Linux or Windows implementations yet, though
it should be easy enough to do as all you need is php-cli and 
libreadline

This is GNU General Public License, version 2 and later.
